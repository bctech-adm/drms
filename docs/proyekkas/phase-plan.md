# ProyekKas — Phase plan F0–F7

- **Status:** accepted (user, GATE F0 2026-09-23); F1 status updated 2026-09-23 (spike gate passed; foundation on staging); F2 status updated 2026-09-24 (F2a–F2e done and deployed to staging `e9c07ab`; UAT run 4 56/59 PASS; **F2 ready for gate**) · **Date:** 2026-09-23 · **Author:** Analyst/Architect (Phase 0)
- **Basis:** `architecture.md`, ADR 0001–0008 (this folder), ADR 0009–0011 (other agent), requirements v1.0
  (+ v1.1 in parallel), `/opt/infra/CLAUDE.md` §1 (workflow: stop and report at the end of every phase, wait
  for user approval), §5 (Definition of Done).
- **Estimates** are person-days (pd) of focused agent/developer work incl. tests, as ranges; they are
  ESTIMATES without historical velocity data for this team. Calendar time depends on user review latency
  at each gate and on client answers.

## Agents

| Agent | Role in this project |
|---|---|
| analyst | ADRs, requirements refinements, acceptance criteria, capacity re-measurement, spikes write-up |
| nextjs-developer | `apps/web` (Payload config, collections, domain services, `/api/v1`, admin custom views, PDF, jobs) |
| flutter-developer (**new**, to be defined in `/opt/infra/.claude/agents/`) | `apps/mobile` APK, offline queue, geofence/mock detection, FCM, signing |
| qa-security | test plans, negative authz tests, Semgrep rules (Local API `overrideAccess`), ZAP, load test, restore drill |
| docs-versioning | CHANGELOG, semver/tags, user guides (Bahasa Indonesia), runbooks |
| infra-engineer | Keycloak realms/clients, Traefik routes/middlewares, Postgres DBs/roles/pg_hba, backup script, `infra-deploy` extension — **touches shared infra → coordinate with the infra session; changes via its own plan/ADR revisions** |
| odoo-developer | only F7 (mirror target side, per ADR 0009) |

## Phases

### F0 — Discovery & design (this phase)
- **Scope/deliverables:** requirements v1.1 + open questions + traceability (other agent);
  `architecture.md`, ADR 0001–0008, `phase-plan.md` (this); ADR 0009–0011 (other agent).
- **Estimate:** 3–4 pd (done in parallel).
- **Gate:** user approves ADRs (status → accepted) and answers blocking client questions: hostnames,
  numbering reset policy, approval rules/signature positions, original-receipt retention, volumes.

### F1 — Foundation (incl. go/no-go spikes)

> **Status 2026-09-23**
> - **Item 1 spike gate: PASSED** — Payload 3.90.1 = **GO** (user decision 2026-09-23). Spikes a–h:
>   a/b/c/d/e/g/h GO, f PARTIAL resolved by the user-approved minimal admin CSP (architecture §3.3). Evidence
>   `spikes/f1-spike-report.md`; ADR 0001/0002/0003/0006/0007 + architecture revised the same day.
>   Other user decisions: no `json`/`code` field editors in the admin; offline session max 30 days (+ 14 d idle).
> - **Item 7 infra: DONE** (infra `main` commit `c557c28`, runbook `/opt/infra/docs/runbooks/proyekkas-drms-onboarding.md`;
>   verified by Lead 2026-09-23): network `drms-kas-edge` 10.100.7.0/24; DBs `pk_drms`/`pk_drms_stg` + 6 roles +
>   pg_hba; realms `drms`/`drms-staging` imported (back-channel logout disabled; app → Keycloak via public
>   issuer, hairpin); Traefik `drms-pk-stg-{auth,api-v1,api-rest,web}` + `auth-drms-token`; client secrets at
>   `/opt/infra/identity/keycloak/secrets/drms{,-staging}-<client>.secret`; backup `MEDIA_VOLUMES` loop active.
>   Residual (verify once the app runs): staging app deploy (compose `/opt/infra/staging/drms-proyekkas/` not
>   created yet), backup of real `pk_drms*` dumps + media volume, realm SMTP (for `execute-actions-email`),
>   prod A record + prod routers.
> - **Remaining F1 items:** 2 (scaffold exists from the spike; still `packages/api-contract`, `deploy/`
>   compose prod/staging, CI pipeline; image build with `next build --webpack`, ≥ 2 GiB build env),
>   3 (config hardening: `maxDepth`, upload limits), 4 (all masters, users/role sync via Keycloak Admin API,
>   devices, web-sessions), 5 (migrations/grants/triggers per revised ADR 0006, audit hooks factory,
>   numbering service, media collections + **remote-URL guard factory**, `/api/v1` skeleton, OpenAPI),
>   6 (seed data); remove spike-only code (`spike-parents`, `spike-docs`, `/v1/spike/numbered`,
>   `spikeHeartbeat`/`spikeMidnight`, `apps/web/spike/**`); read-only custom field components replacing
>   `json` editors. Open questions to close in F1: Admin REST reachability through `ipallowlist-admin` from
>   `drms-kas-edge` (ADR 0003 §6); worker egress network; `__Host-` cookie + inactivity logout on staging HTTPS.
>
> **Status 2026-09-23 — F1 foundation (develop `e2bf46b`)**
> - **Items 2–6 implemented** in `apps/web/` (masters, users/role sync via Keycloak Admin API, devices,
>   web-sessions, migrations/grants/triggers, audit hooks, numbering, media collections, `/api/v1` health/me/
>   masters/devices, `packages/api-contract/openapi.json`, idempotent seed with fictional default data);
>   spike-only code removed. ADR 0002/0003/0004/0006/0007 + architecture updated (Revision history).
> - **Staging live:** `https://drms-kas.staging.bimacreative.tech` — separate web + worker + one-shot migrate
>   (ADR 0002 §7), deployed by the infra Lead at `/opt/infra/staging/drms-proyekkas/` (runbook Langkah 5);
>   images built locally on the VPS until GHCR (`TEMPORARY`).
> - **GitHub:** repo `bctech-adm/drms` (public); CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`: verify, integration,
>   security, build) **green on the first run** — run 35857158248, commit `e2bf46b`, branch `develop`.
> - Open questions of the previous block closed: Admin REST reachability (internal networks
>   `drms-kc-admin[-stg]`, ADR 0003 §6); worker egress (`drms-kas-edge`).
> - **Remaining for F1:** (1) `HEAD` on `/api/v1/health` (currently 404, GET only) — in progress on another
>   branch; (2) SMTP adapter / onboarding e-mail — pending infra (realm + app SMTP, `no-reply@bimacreative.tech`);
>   (3) **F1 gate review**. Not yet in the repo (for the gate review — whether they block F1 is a Lead decision): prod compose
>   under `deploy/`, GHCR push + deploy jobs in CI, prod A record/routers; `__Host-` cookie + inactivity logout
>   check on staging HTTPS.
- **Scope:**
  1. **Spike week (first 3–4 pd, go/no-go for Payload):** (a) OIDC web login with `disableLocalStrategy` +
     `oidcSession` strategy + SSO button + logout in Payload admin; (b) `mobileBearer` strategy on a
     `/api/v1/me` endpoint with a real Keycloak token (confirm `sid` claim, internal `iss`); (c) append-only
     `audit_logs` written via `payload.create` in the request transaction as `pk_drms_app` with triggers
     active; (d) numbering allocation in-transaction; (e) worker bundling of the Payload config;
     (f) strict CSP vs Payload admin; (g) idle RAM of web/worker (`docker stats`).
  2. Monorepo scaffold (`apps/web`, `packages/api-contract`, `deploy/`), Dockerfile (runner + migrate
     targets), compose (prod/staging), CI pipeline (lint/type/test/Semgrep/gitleaks/Trivy/Hadolint/build/GHCR).
  3. Payload config: i18n `id`, TZ, GraphQL off, `maxDepth`, upload limits, sharp.
  4. All master collections (brief list incl. `uoms`, `vehicles`, `cost-centers`, `document-sequences`,
     `company-settings`), users/role sync with Keycloak Admin API, devices, web-sessions.
  5. DB roles/grants/triggers migrations (ADR 0006), audit hooks factory, numbering service (ADR 0007),
     media collections + resize (ADR 0004), `/api/v1` skeleton (health, me, masters, devices), OpenAPI generation.
  6. Seed data: company DRMS, categories, UoMs, cash accounts, vehicle `DA 1234 XY` (Hilux), cost center
     "Ops Palangka Banjar", employees Budi, Doni, Citra, Budi Hartono, sari, bank Mandiri
     account of Doni Pratama.
  7. **[DONE 2026-09-23, infra `c557c28`]** Infra (coordinated): realms `drms`/`drms-staging` + clients + service account; DBs `pk_drms`/`pk_drms_stg`
     + roles + pg_hba; Traefik routes + new middlewares; token-endpoint rate-limit rule; staging deploy;
     backup `MEDIA_VOLUMES`.
- **Dependencies:** F0 gate; infra session availability.
- **Agents / estimate:** nextjs-developer 18–26 pd · infra-engineer 4–6 pd · qa-security 4–5 pd ·
  analyst 2–3 pd · docs-versioning 1–2 pd → **29–42 pd**.
- **Acceptance gate:** ~~spikes (a)–(g) pass or an ADR revision is approved~~ **passed 2026-09-23** (ADR
  revisions approved); staging reachable over HTTPS with SSO; negative tests: app role cannot UPDATE/DELETE/TRUNCATE
  `audit_logs`; APK-style bearer on `/api/<slug>` → never authenticated (403, or 200 `{user:null}` on
  `/api/users/me`; revised per spike §b); inactive user → 401; every master change produces
  audit rows; numbering concurrency test (50 parallel submits → unique, gapless); measured RAM recorded in
  ADR 0002 (revise if > limits); Trivy no CRITICAL.

### F2 — Expense request flow end-to-end (T1–T8) — core business
- **Scope:** expense requests (advance + reimburse) with lines (line `total` primary, unit price display-only,
  server grand total), requesters/creator/"diketahui"/approval positions + signatures, approval rules by
  amount (US-34), approval inbox with budget impact, transfers + automatic KK posting, receipts (many per
  request) + validation flags, LPJ submit/revision/verify, settlement (refund KM / shortfall transfer),
  manual cash in/out, void/reversal, period closing lock, PDF "Pengajuan Biaya" (ADR 0008), in-app
  notifications (push arrives in F4), admin custom views (approval inbox, transfer queue, LPJ verification,
  "Riwayat" tab).
- **Status (2026-09-24): READY FOR GATE**
  - **F2a — DONE** (merged to `develop` `c8c1af6`): expense requests (advance + reimburse) with lines,
    requesters, "Diketahui"/approval positions + signatures, approval rules (US-34; default Owner-only,
    Q-31; "Diketahui" required, Q-07), receipts + validation flags, Reimburse receipt verification
    ("Nota Terverifikasi"), transfers with one automatic KK, manual cash in/out, void/reversal (KM/KK),
    period close/re-open, DB guards (ADR 0005/0006), `Idempotency-Key`, `/api/v1` endpoints + OpenAPI, form
    228 fixture in the integration tests. Onboarding prerequisite: PM per project / manager per cost center
    (architecture §5.2). Also fixed the F1 WebP-thumbnail upload defect (architecture §9.1).
  - **F2b — DONE** (merged `4d952ba`): LPJ/settlement (submit/revision/verify; exact amount settles at
    verification, refund KM / shortfall transfer + KK; ADR 0005), Class B `settlements`/`notifications` DB guards
    (ADR 0006), PDF "Pengajuan Biaya" (ADR 0008 "As implemented"), admin custom views (approval inbox, transfer
    queue, LPJ verification, "Riwayat" tab), in-app notifications (`pushStatus`, push gated off — ADR 0011),
    file endpoint `GET /api/v1/media/{collection}/{id}/file` (ADR 0004 §4a), Reimburse auto-close job (01:15 WITA).
  - **F2c — DONE** (merged `59ba0a4`): requester actions in the web panel — `pk-staff` panel access with
    restricted nav, self-service profile signature, submit/withdraw/cancel/resubmit/receipts/LPJ/confirm via
    `/api/v1` + `Idempotency-Key`, status timeline; admin REST create/edit runs `validateContent` (security fix;
    ADR 0003 §3a).
  - **F2d — DONE** (merged `c11907a`, UAT fixes): Finance verifies Reimburse receipts in **Antrian Transfer**
    (per receipt Valid/Tolak, flags reviewed, "Verifikasi semua nota"); "Profil & tanda tangan" linked for every
    panel role incl. Owner; hint above "Baris item" for the Payload 3.90.1 row race.
  - **F2e — DONE** (merged `e9c07ab`, UAT fixes): "Diketahui" **delegated** to an eligible Owner, else Admin, when
    the PM / cost-center manager is a requester/creator or missing (user decision 2026-09-24 option a; Q-07/Q-08
    edge case; architecture §5.2); resubmit shows the old number; office-only fields hidden for Staff/PM;
    operational 4xx logged at warn; Finance self-involvement guard (service + DB triggers, G17); audit actions
    `acknowledge_delegated`, `access_denied` (ADR 0006).
  - **Deployed:** staging runs image `proyekkas-web:0.1.0-stg-e9c07ab` (web + worker). **UAT seed**
    (`apps/web/src/seed/uat.ts`, env `UAT_USERS`, fictional `*.uji@proyekkas.test` accounts, project `UJI-PRJ`)
    run on staging 2026-09-24. **UAT E2E (Playwright) runs 1–4** — run 4: 56 PASS, 2 FAIL (1.3b by design Q-04;
    5.2 409 instead of 403, refused either way), 1 NOT TESTABLE (4.2) — `uat/f2-uat-report.md`.
  - **F2 acceptance gate — evidence** (awaiting user gate approval):

    | Gate item | Evidence |
    |---|---|
    | Seed form reproduces `228/PB-DRMS/20/IX/2026`, Rp 1.447.500, flags (Rp 124, dates, BBM "bulan") | `tests/integration/form-228.int.test.ts`; UAT run 4 scenario 1 (Rp 1.447.500, Rp 124 and "bulan" flags; date flag by design, Q-04) |
    | PDF reviewed by user | layout **approved by the user 2026-09-24** (receipts on separate pages, 2 per page; logo pending Q-32); printed in UAT run 4 (1.10) |
    | Full negative-authz suite (§7.4) green | `tests/integration/{authz,f2-authz-db,f2c-requester-web,f2d-finance-receipts,f2e-uat-fixes}.int.test.ts`; UAT run 4 scenario 5 |
    | Every §8 event in audit with old→new | `tests/integration/audit.int.test.ts` + flow suites; `acknowledge_delegated` / `access_denied` in `f2e-uat-fixes.int`; Riwayat in UAT run 4 (1.11, 4.1) |
    | Closed period rejects postings at DB level | `tests/integration/f2-authz-db.int.test.ts` (raw SQL as the app role; ADR 0005) |
    | PDF render peak RSS measured | ≈ 138 MiB isolated, 149 MiB web cgroup after 3 renders (ADR 0008) |

  - **Carried over (not blocking the gate, proposed):** the F6 backlog below, plus "5.2 409 vs 403 wording"
    (state check answers before the G1 guard) and an "Admin Uji" test account for the delegation UAT (step 4.2).
  - **F2 acceptance gate: READY FOR GATE** (user decision pending).
- **Dependencies:** F1 gate.
- **Agents / estimate:** nextjs-developer 26–36 pd · qa-security 7–9 pd · analyst 1–2 pd · docs 1–2 pd →
  **35–49 pd**.
- **Acceptance gate:** seed client form reproduces `228/PB-DRMS/20/IX/2026`, grand total **Rp 1.447.500**,
  flags (hotel diff 124 vs tolerance, receipts dated 21/09 after 20/09, BBM unit "bulan"); PDF reviewed by
  user; full negative-authz suite (§7.4 architecture) green; every §8 event appears in audit with old→new;
  closed period rejects postings at DB level; PDF render peak RSS measured.

### F3 — Web dashboards, reports, exports
- **Scope:** role dashboards (Owner, Finance, PM; Staff optional) as admin custom views — **prototype not
  available**: layouts proposed by analyst from US-27/28/12/13 and approved by user before build; cash
  recap per category/project/period, balances per account, budget disbursed vs realised, requests report,
  global audit log with filters; CSV/XLSX (library decision — architecture §9.4) and PDF exports.
- **Dependencies:** F2 (data), user approval of dashboard wireframes.
- **Agents / estimate:** nextjs-developer 14–20 pd · analyst 2–3 pd (wireframes, KPI definitions) ·
  qa 3–4 pd · docs 1 pd → **20–28 pd**.
- **Acceptance gate:** numbers reconcile with ledger SQL on seed + generated data; exports open in Excel
  (id-ID locale) correctly; PM sees only team projects.

### F4 — Android APK (Flutter)
- **Scope:** login (AppAuth/PKCE, ADR 0003/0010), device registration, role home screens, expense
  requests with lines + camera receipts (device compression), owner approval inbox with signature,
  receipts/LPJ, notifications (FCM, ADR 0011), offline queue for attendance + drafts (ADR 0010), mock
  location & root detection, signed release APK in CI. Backend: `/api/v1/sync/batch`, idempotency,
  files endpoint, min-version check.
- **Dependencies:** F2 API stable (v1 contract frozen for these endpoints); ADR 0010/0011 accepted;
  Firebase project (client/Google account) available.
- **Agents / estimate:** flutter-developer 30–42 pd · nextjs-developer 5–8 pd · qa-security 6–8 pd ·
  docs 1–2 pd → **42–60 pd**.
- **Acceptance gate:** E2E on physical Android device(s) against staging: create → approve (owner on
  phone) → transfer (web) → receipts → LPJ; offline check-in synced with "offline" flag and server time;
  revoked device blocked ≤ 1 request; APK signed; no secrets in APK (static scan).

### F5 — Project, progress, attendance, reports
- **Scope:** projects & stages (weights = 100 %, templates, archive), progress reports (≤ 5 photos,
  edit ≤ 24 h), progress vs budget colours, budget addenda (T12), team assignments, attendance (geofence
  server check, selfie, PM on-behalf, corrections T10, monthly recap, work schedules/holidays), late-report
  reminders, vehicle cost report; APK screens for these.
- **Dependencies:** F4 (APK base), F1 masters.
- **Agents / estimate:** nextjs-developer 14–20 pd · flutter-developer 10–15 pd · qa 5–6 pd · docs 1 pd →
  **30–42 pd**.
- **Acceptance gate:** US-01, 02, 09–16, 18, 29–31 criteria pass; geofence rejects outside radius and
  mock location; progress % only changes via reports (audit shows before→after).

### F6 — Hardening & release
- **Scope:** security review (OWASP ASVS L1 basics), ZAP baseline on staging, load test (≈ 30 concurrent
  field users + 5 office users, ESTIMATE target) with RAM re-measurement, backup + restore drill (DB +
  media), hash-chain decision (ADR 0006 §5), user guides per role (Bahasa Indonesia), deploy & ops
  runbooks, UAT checklist per user story, go-live data migration (opening balances, sequence start values),
  OCR receipts (nice-to-have, only if time allows).
- **Backlog carried in (2026-09-24):** server-side 302 to `/admin/login` for unauthenticated admin routes
  (today Payload renders a 200 shell that leaks only page titles, no data); settlement reversal (void of
  refund KM / shortfall transfer currently 409); signed/time-limited media URLs (ADR 0004 §4); prod compose
  + GHCR push/deploy jobs; container uid not mapped to a host user for prod secrets; `PUSH_FCM_ENABLED` in
  the env schema (F4); ~~self-involvement guard for Finance receipt verification~~ (**done in F2e**, architecture
  §5.5 G17); Payload 3.90.1
  admin form-state race (adding an array row while a form-state request is pending leaves a skeleton row —
  file upstream issue; UI hint added in F2d); **5.2 409 vs 403 wording** (a requester's `approve` on a request in
  "Menunggu Diketahui" answers 409 from the state check before the G1 403 — refused either way, UAT run 4);
  **"Admin Uji" test account** for the delegated-acknowledge UAT step 4.2 (the only staging Admin is the user's).
- **Dependencies:** F2–F5.
- **Agents / estimate:** qa-security 6–9 pd · nextjs-developer 4–6 pd · flutter-developer 2–3 pd ·
  docs-versioning 4–6 pd · infra-engineer 1–2 pd · analyst 1–2 pd → **18–28 pd**.
- **Acceptance gate:** no open HIGH/CRITICAL; restore drill within RTO (platform ADR 0006: ≤ 4 h per
  client); RAM within ADR 0002 limits under load or approved revision; UAT signed by client.

### F7 — Odoo mirror (after go-live)
- **Scope:** per ADR 0009 (outbox → worker → Odoo 19 JSON-2 API), mapping of masters, ledger rows
  (ADR 0005 hints), expenses, projects/analytics, attendance; reconciliation report; cut-over plan.
- **Dependencies:** F6; Odoo DB for DRMS provisioned (`drms_prod` in pool — infra); ADR 0009 accepted.
- **Agents / estimate:** nextjs-developer 8–12 pd · odoo-developer 6–10 pd · qa 3–4 pd · analyst 2 pd ·
  docs 1 pd → **20–29 pd**.
- **Acceptance gate:** idempotent re-sync; mirrored balances equal ProyekKas balances per period;
  no writes from Odoo back (one-way).

## Totals (ESTIMATE)

| Phase | pd (range) |
|---|---|
| F0 | 3–4 |
| F1 | 29–42 |
| F2 | 35–49 |
| F3 | 20–28 |
| F4 | 42–60 |
| F5 | 30–42 |
| F6 | 18–28 |
| F7 | 20–29 |
| **Total** | **197–282** |

Parallelism: F3 (web) and F4 (APK) can overlap once F2's API is frozen; F5 backend can start during F4.

## Top risks (overall)

| # | Risk | Likelihood / impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Payload OIDC-only auth / admin integration** or append-only writes behave differently than read in source (e.g. hidden UPDATE/DELETE, admin needs local strategy) | M / H | F1 spike week as go/no-go; fallback custom Next.js admin (ADR 0001 Rollback) decided before F2 | nextjs-dev + analyst |
| 2 | **RAM budget**: ProyekKas ≈ 57 % of the platform's remaining 2.5 GiB (steady, ESTIMATE); real Payload footprint unknown | M / H | measure in F1 and F6; ordered reduction steps (ADR 0002 §6); escalate to user per platform ADR 0004 | analyst + infra |
| 3 | **Scope & ambiguity**: prototype missing, many open client questions (approval rules, reset policy, retention, dashboards), 197–282 pd | H / M | gate-by-gate delivery; wireframe approval before F3; defer OCR and optional roles | Lead |
| 4 | **Offline sync & trust** (APK): conflicts, replay, clock/GPS spoofing | M / H | server-side state machine on replay, idempotency keys, device time only as comparison, mock detection (ADR 0010) | flutter + nextjs + qa |
| 5 | **Shared-infra changes** (Keycloak realm + token rate limit, Traefik middlewares, pg_hba, backup script, `infra-deploy`) can collide with the platform session or other clients | M / M | changes as separate infra tasks with their own review, staging first, coordination note to infra session; ProyekKas never edits `/opt/infra` directly | infra-engineer |
| 6 | Payload 4 major (canary exists) shortens 3.x support | L–M / M | pin 3.90.1, monthly minors via staging; evaluate 4.x only after GA + guide (new ADR) | nextjs-dev |
| 7 | Excel export library lacks a maintained MIT/Apache option on npm | M / L | CSV baseline; fresh evaluation in F3 | nextjs-dev |

## Items requiring user/Lead decision before F1
1. ~~DB rename~~ — **accepted by user 2026-09-23:** `pk_drms` / `pk_drms_stg`.
2. ~~Hostnames~~ — **user 2026-09-23: platform subdomain** → `drms-kas.bimacreative.tech` (new manual A record) / `drms-kas.staging.bimacreative.tech`.
3. ~~Numbering~~ — user 2026-09-23: PB never resets, go-live `startAt` 229.
4. ~~Receipt originals~~ — user 2026-09-23: discard after resize (2000 px), keep sha256 fingerprint.
5. ~~APK offline session~~ — user 2026-09-23: 14 days. Reimburse auto-close days: still default per ADR.
7. Shared-infra coordination with the infra session — **approved by user 2026-09-23**.
6. ~~flutter-developer agent definition~~ — done: `.claude/agents/flutter-developer.md` in this repo (ADR 0010).
